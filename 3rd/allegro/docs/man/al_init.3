.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Like al_install_system(3), but automatically passes in the version and
uses the atexit function visible in the current binary.
.RS
.PP
Note: It is typically wrong to call al_init anywhere except the final
game binary.
In particular, do not call it inside a shared library unless you know
what you\[aq]re doing.
In those cases, it is better to call al_install_system either with a
\f[C]NULL\f[] atexit_ptr, or with a pointer to atexit provided by the
user of this shared library.
