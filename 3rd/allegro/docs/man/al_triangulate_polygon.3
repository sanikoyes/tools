#include\ <allegro5/allegro_primitives.h>

bool\ al_triangulate_polygon(

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Divides a simple polygon into triangles, with zero or more other simple
polygons subtracted from it \- the holes.
The holes cannot touch or intersect with the outline of the main
polygon.
Simple means the polygon does not have to be convex but must not be
self\-overlapping.
.PP
\f[I]Parameters:\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
vertices \- Interleaved array of (x, y) vertex coordinates for each of
the polygons, including holes.
.IP \[bu] 2
vertex_stride \- distance (in bytes) between successive pairs of
vertices in the array.
.IP \[bu] 2
vertex_counts \- Number of vertices for each polygon.
The number of vertices in the main polygon is given by vertex_counts[0]
and must be at least three.
Subsequent elements indicate the number of vertices in each hole.
The array must be terminated with an element with value zero.
.IP \[bu] 2
emit_triangle \- a function to be called for every set of three points
that form a triangle.
The function is passed the indices of the points in \f[C]vertices\f[]
and \f[C]userdata\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
userdata \- arbitrary data to be passed to emit_triangle.
