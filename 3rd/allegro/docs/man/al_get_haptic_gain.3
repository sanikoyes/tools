.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns the current gain of the device.
Gain is much like volume for sound, it is as if every effect\[aq]s
intensity is multiplied by it.
Gain is a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
Only works correctly if al_get_haptic_capabilities(3) returns a value
that has ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_GAIN(3)ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_CONSTANTS(3) set.
If this is not set, this function will simply return 1.0 and all effects
will be played without any gain influence.

\f[I][Unstable API]:\f[] Perhaps could be simplified due to limited
support for all the exposed features across all of the platforms.
Awaiting feedback from users.
