.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns the current automatic centering intensity of the device.
Depending on the device automatic centering may ensure that the axes of
the device are centered again automatically after playing a haptic
effect.
The return value can be between 0.0 and 1.0.
The value 0.0 means automatic centering is disabled, and 1.0 means
automatic centering is enabled at full strength.
Any value in between those two extremes means partial automatic
centering is enabled.
Some platforms do not support partial automatic centering.
If that is the case, a value of less than 0.5 means it is turned off,
while a value equal to or higher to 0.5 means it is turned on.
Can only work if al_get_haptic_capabilities(3) returns a value that has
ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_AUTOCENTER(3)ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_CONSTANTS(3) set.
If not, this function returns 0.0.

support for all the exposed features across all of the platforms.
Awaiting feedback from users.
