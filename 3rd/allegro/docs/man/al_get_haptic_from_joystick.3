.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
If the joystick has haptic capabilities, returns the associated haptic
device handle.
Otherwise returns NULL.
It\[aq]s neccesary to call this again every time the joystick
configuration changes, such as through hot plugging.
In that case, the old haptic device must be released using
al_release_haptic(3).

\f[I][Unstable API]:\f[] Perhaps could be simplified due to limited
support for all the exposed features across all of the platforms.
Awaiting feedback from users.
