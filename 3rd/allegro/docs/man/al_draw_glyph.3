\f[C]
#include\ <allegro5/allegro_font.h>

void\ al_draw_glyph(const\ ALLEGRO_FONT\ *f,\ ALLEGRO_COLOR\ color,\ float\ x,\ float\ y,
\ \ \ int\ codepoint)
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Draws the glyph that corresponds with \f[C]codepoint\f[] in the given
\f[C]color\f[] using the given \f[C]font\f[].
If \f[C]font\f[] does not have such a glyph, nothing will be drawn.
.PP
To draw a string as left to right horizontal text you will need to use
al_get_glyph_advance(3) to determine the position of each glyph.
For drawing strings in other directions, such as top to down, use
al_get_glyph_dimensions(3) to determine the size and position of each
glyph.
.PP
If you have to draw many glyphs at the same time, use
al_hold_bitmap_drawing(3) with true as the parameter, before drawing the
glyphs, and then call al_hold_bitmap_drawing(3) again with false as a
parameter when done drawing the glyphs to further enhance performance.
