.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Creates a new native file dialog.
You should only have one such dialog opened at a time.
.PP
Parameters:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]initial_path\f[]: The initial search path and filename.
Can be NULL.
To start with a blank file name the string should end with a directory
separator (this should be the common case).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]title\f[]: Title of the dialog.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]patterns\f[]: A list of semi\-colon separated patterns to match.
This should not contain any whitespace characters.
If a pattern contains the \[aq]/\[aq] character, then it is treated as a
MIME type (e.g.
\[aq]image/png\[aq]).
Not all platforms support file patterns.
If the native dialog does not provide support, this parameter is
ignored.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]mode\f[]: 0, or a combination of the following flags:
.TP
.B ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FILE_MUST_EXIST
If supported by the native dialog, it will not allow entering new names,
but just allow existing files to be selected.
Else it is ignored.

.B ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SAVE

Returns:
.PP
A handle to the dialog which you can pass to
al_show_native_file_dialog(3) to display it, and from which you then can
query the results using al_get_native_file_dialog_count(3) and
al_get_native_file_dialog_path(3).
When you are done, call al_destroy_native_file_dialog(3) on it.
.PP
If a dialog window could not be created then this function returns NULL.
