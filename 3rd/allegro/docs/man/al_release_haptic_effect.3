.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP

\f[C]
#include\ <allegro5/allegro.h>

bool\ al_release_haptic_effect(ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_EFFECT_ID\ *id)
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Releases a previously uploaded haptic effect from the device it has been
uploaded to, allowing for other effects to be uploaded.
The play_id must be a valid ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_EFFECT_ID(3) obtained from
al_upload_haptic_effect(3), al_upload_and_play_haptic_effect(3) or
al_rumble_haptic(3).
.PP
This function is called automatically when you call al_release_haptic(3)
on a ALLEGRO_HAPTIC(3) for all effects that are still uploaded to the
device.
Therefore this function is most useful if you want to upload and release
haptic effects dynamically, for example as a way to circumvent the limit
imposed by al_get_max_haptic_effects(3).
.PP
Returns true on success, false if the effect couldn\[aq]t be released
for any reason such as when NULL is passed, the effect is not active or
failure to release the effect by the driver.

\f[I][Unstable API]:\f[] Perhaps could be simplified due to limited
support for all the exposed features across all of the platforms.
Awaiting feedback from users.
