.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Stop capturing audio data.
Note that the audio recorder is still active and consuming resources, so
if you are finished recording you should destroy it with
al_destroy_audio_recorder(3).
.PP
You may still receive a few events after you call this function as the
device flushes the buffer.
.PP
If you restart the recorder, it will begin recording at the beginning of
the next fragment buffer.
