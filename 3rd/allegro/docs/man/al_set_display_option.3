.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Change an option that was previously set for a display.
After displays are created, they take on the options set with
al_set_new_display_option(3).
Calling al_set_new_display_option(3) subsequently only changes options
for newly created displays, and doesn\[aq]t touch the options of already
created displays.
al_set_display_option(3) allows changing some of these values.
Not all display options can be changed or changing them will have no
effect.
Changing options other than those listed below is undefined.
.IP \[bu] 2
ALLEGRO_SUPPORTED_ORIENTATIONS \- This can be changed to allow new or
restrict previously enabled orientations of the screen/device.
See al_set_new_display_option(3) for more information on this option.
