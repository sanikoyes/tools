#include\ <allegro5/allegro.h>

ALLEGRO_CONFIG\ *al_get_system_config(void)
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns the system configuration structure.
The returned configuration should not be destroyed with
al_destroy_config(3).
This is mainly used for configuring Allegro and its addons.
You may populate this configuration before Allegro is installed to
control things like the logging levels and other features.
.PP
Allegro will try to populate this configuration by loading a
configuration file from a few different locations, in this order:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]Unix only:\f[] /etc/allegro5rc
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]Unix only:\f[] $HOME/allegro5rc
.IP \[bu] 2
allegro5.cfg next to the executable
.PP
If multiple copies are found, then they are merged using
al_merge_config_into(3).
.PP
The contents of this file are documented inside a prototypical
allegro5.cfg that you can find in the root directory of the source
distributions of Allegro.
Note that Allegro will not look into that file unless you make a copy of
it and place it next to your executable!
