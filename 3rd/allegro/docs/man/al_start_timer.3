.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Start the timer specified.
From then, the timer\[aq]s counter will increment at a constant rate,
and it will begin generating events.
Starting a timer that is already started does nothing.
Starting a timer that was stopped will reset the timer\[aq]s counter,
effectively restarting the timer from the beginning.
