.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Flags to specify how to create a vertex or an index buffer.
.IP \[bu] 2
ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_STREAM \- Hints to the driver that the buffer is
written to often, but used only a few times per frame
.IP \[bu] 2
ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_STATIC \- Hints to the driver that the buffer is
written to once and is used often
.IP \[bu] 2
ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC \- Hints to the driver that the buffer is
written to often and is used often
.IP \[bu] 2
ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_READWRITE \- Specifies that you want to be able read
from this buffer.
By default this is disabled for performance.
Some platforms (like OpenGL ES) do not support reading from vertex
buffers, so if you pass this flag to \f[C]al_create_vertex_buffer\f[] or
\f[C]al_create_index_buffer\f[] the call will fail.
