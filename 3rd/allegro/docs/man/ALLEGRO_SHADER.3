.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
An ALLEGRO_SHADER(3) is a program that runs on the GPU.
It combines both a vertex and a pixel shader.
(In OpenGL terms, an ALLEGRO_SHADER(3) is actually a \f[I]program\f[]
which has one or more \f[I]shaders\f[] attached.
This can be confusing.)
.PP
The source code for the underlying vertex or pixel shader can be
provided either as GLSL or HLSL, depending on the value of
ALLEGRO_SHADER_PLATFORM(3) used when creating it.
