.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Register an identify handler for al_identify_bitmap(3).
The given function will be used to detect files for the given extension.
It will be called with a single argument of type ALLEGRO_FILE(3) which
is a file handle opened for reading and located at the first byte of the
file.
The handler should try to read as few bytes as possible to safely
determine if the given file contents correspond to the type with the
extension and return true in that case, false otherwise.
The file handle must not be closed but there is no need to reset it to
the beginning.
.PP
The extension should include the leading dot (\[aq].\[aq]) character.
It will be matched case\-insensitively.
.PP
The \f[C]identifier\f[] argument may be NULL to unregister an entry.

Returns true on success, false on error.
Returns false if unregistering an entry that doesn\[aq]t exist.
