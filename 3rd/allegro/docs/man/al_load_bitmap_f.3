.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Loads an image from an ALLEGRO_FILE(3) stream into a new
ALLEGRO_BITMAP(3).
The file type is determined by the passed \[aq]ident\[aq] parameter,
which is a file name extension including the leading dot.
If (and only if) \[aq]ident\[aq] is NULL, the file type is determined
with al_identify_bitmap_f(3) instead.
.PP
This is the same as calling al_load_bitmap_flags_f(3) with 0 for the
flags parameter.
.PP
Returns NULL on error.
The file remains open afterwards.

\f[I]Note:\f[] the core Allegro library does not support any image file
formats by default.

handler.
