.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Call this in response to the ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_HALT_DRAWING(3)
event.
This is currently necessary for Android and iOS as you are not allowed
to draw to your display while it is not being shown.
If you do not call this function to let the operating system know that
you have stopped drawing or if you call it to late the application
likely will be considered misbehaving and get terminated.
