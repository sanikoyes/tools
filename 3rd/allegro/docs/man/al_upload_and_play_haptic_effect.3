bool\ al_upload_and_play_haptic_effect(ALLEGRO_HAPTIC\ *hap,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Uploads the haptic effect to the device and starts playback immediately.
Returns true if the upload and playback were successful, false if either
failed.
.PP
In case false is returned, the haptic effect will be automatically
released as if al_release_haptic_effect(3) had been called, so there is
no need to call it again manually in this case.
However, if true is returned, it is necessary to call
al_release_haptic_effect(3) when the effect isn\[aq]t needed anymore, to
prevent the amount of available effects on the haptic devicefrom running
out.
