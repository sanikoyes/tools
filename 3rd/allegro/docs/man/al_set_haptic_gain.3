.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sets the gain of the haptic device if supported.
Gain is much like volume for sound, it is as if every effect\[aq]s
intensity is multiplied by it.
Gain is a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
Returns true if set sucessfully, false if not.
Only works if al_get_haptic_capabilities(3) returns a value that has
ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_GAIN(3)ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_CONSTANTS(3) set.
If not, this function returns false, and all effects will be played
without any gain influence.
