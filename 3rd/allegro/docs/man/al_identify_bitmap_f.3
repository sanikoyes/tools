.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tries to guess the bitmap file type of the open ALLEGRO_FILE by reading
the first few bytes.
By default Allegro cannot recognize any file types, but calling
al_init_image_addon(3) will add detection of (some of) the types it can
read.
You can also use al_register_bitmap_identifier(3) to add identification
for custom file types.
.PP
Returns a pointer to a static string with a file extension for the type,
including the leading dot.
For example ".png" or ".jpg".
Returns NULL if the bitmap type cannot be determined.
