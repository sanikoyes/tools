.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Draws a filled simple polygon with zero or more other simple polygons
subtracted from it \- the holes.
The holes cannot touch or intersect with the outline of the filled
polygon.
.IP \[bu] 2
vertices \- Interleaved array of (x, y) vertex coordinates for each of
the polygons, including holes.
.IP \[bu] 2
vertex_counts \- Number of vertices for each polygon.
The number of vertices in the filled polygon is given by
vertex_counts[0] and must be at least three.
Subsequent elements indicate the number of vertices in each hole.
The array must be terminated with an element with value zero.
.IP \[bu] 2
color \- Color of the filled polygon
.PP
All hole vertices must use the opposite order (clockwise with y down) of
the polygon vertices.
All hole vertices must be inside the main polygon and no hole may
overlap the main polygon.

\ \ \ \ \ 90,\ \ 10,\ //\ hole,\ upper\ right
\ \ \ \ \ 90,\ \ 90\ \ //\ hole,\ lower\ right
};
int\ vertex_counts[]\ =\ {
\ \ \ 4,\ //\ number\ of\ vertices\ for\ filled\ polygon
\ \ \ 3,\ //\ number\ of\ vertices\ for\ hole
\ \ \ 0\ \ //\ terminator
};

.PP
There are 7 vertices: four for an outer square from (0, 0) to (100, 100)
in anti\-clockwise order, and three more for an inner triangle in
clockwise order.
The outer main polygon uses vertices 0 to 3 (inclusive) and the hole
uses vertices 4 to 6 (inclusive).
