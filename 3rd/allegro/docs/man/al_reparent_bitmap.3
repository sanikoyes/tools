.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
For a sub\-bitmap, changes the parent, position and size.
This is the same as destroying the bitmap and re\-creating it with
al_create_sub_bitmap(3) \- except the bitmap pointer stays the same.
This has many uses, for example an animation player could return a
single bitmap which can just be re\-parented to different animation
frames without having to re\-draw the contents.
Or a sprite atlas could re\-arrange its sprites without having to
invalidate all existing bitmaps.
