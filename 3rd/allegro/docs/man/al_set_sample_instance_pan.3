.SH DESCRIPTION

Set the pan value on a sample instance.
A value of \-1.0 means to play the sample only through the left speaker;
+1.0 means only through the right speaker; 0.0 means the sample is
centre balanced.
A special value ALLEGRO_AUDIO_PAN_NONE(3) disables panning and plays the
sample at its original level.
This will be louder than a pan value of 0.0.
