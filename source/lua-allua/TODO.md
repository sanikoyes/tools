To-Do List
==========

* All userdata should be prefixed for allegro
* Still put as `allegro5.type`, but the typename should be al_type or something
  to avoid collision with other libs with the same typename
* This came up as an issue with event_queue trezker has in a different project
* Work out a guide for using Allua with a C/C++ project
* Add `data/brick.png`, `data/ball.png` and `data/envelope.png` for
  `examples/breakout.lua`
