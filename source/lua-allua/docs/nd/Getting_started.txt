Title: Getting started

Topic: The allegro5 table
All the Lua functions in this library are under the allegro5 table.
This is not clear by the documentation for each class.
So to use Mouse functions for example, you need to use allegro5.Mouse.foo(), not Mouse.foo().
The functions that don't belong to a class are naturally accessible as allegro5.foo().

If you would prefer not having to write allegro5 on everything
 you could globalize everything under allegro5, or selected parts.
But there's no guarantee this will not conflict with other stuff in Lua,
 so you do it at your own risk.

Allua documentation currently lacks full descriptions on the functions.
Therefore I refer you to the official documentation of Allegro5 for full documentation
 while you use the Allua docs for the syntax differences.
This is because Allegro5 itself is still under development.
